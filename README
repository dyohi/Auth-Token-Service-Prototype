== Auth-Token-Service-Prototype

This is a fork of https://github.com/matteomelani/Auth-Token-Service-Prototype. I have updated this 
project for use with Rails 3.2 and [Devise 2.0](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

This project aims to create a fully-functioning JSON web service with web-based 
front-end administration through the use of ActiveAdmin.

== Getting Started

1. Migrate database:
		<tt>rake db:migrate</tt>

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/

3. Create a user using the "Sign Up" link

4. Upon successfully signing in you will be redirected to the home page where
your email and authentication token will be displayed at the top of the screen.
		
5. Once you have you authentication token you can access access the courses routes
by passing your authentication token with the url.

		For example, to get a list of courses you may use the url:
		<tt>http://localhost:3000/courses?auth_token=[insert your token here]</tt>

	I recommend using [RESTClient](http://www.restclient.net) for testing web services.
